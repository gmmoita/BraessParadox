# Pigou network                                  #
#                                                #
# Based on Pigou's example. Two additional nodes #
# were created to avoid parallel links: n1 and   #
# nf. The former corresponds to the link with    #
# cost always 1 and the latter to the link with  #
# cost that equal to the (normalised) flow. To   #
# keep the same resulting values, the s-n1 and   #
# s-nf links (type 0) always cost 0, the link    #
# n1-t (type 1) always cost 1 and the link nf-t  #
# (type f) is always the (normalised) flow.      #
#                                                #
